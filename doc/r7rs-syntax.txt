OPTIONS                                          *r7rs-syntax-options*

For all options below, if both global and buffer local ones are found, the
buffer local one takes precedence.

                                                       *g:r7rs_strict*
                                                       *b:r7rs_strict*
The following lets syntax highlight strictly obey the Scheme language
specification in R7RS: it restricts use of `[]` and `{}` as parentheses (see
|g:r7rs_more_parens|) and rejects some identifiers that could be accepted in
the wild (see |g:r7rs_strict_identifier|).
>
    let _:r7rs_strict = 1  " default: 0
<
where `_` reads either `g` or `b` henceforth. Turning it on is equivalent to
setting
>
    let _:r7rs_more_parens = ''
    let _:r7rs_strict_identifier = 1
<

Note: If |_:r7rs_strict| is set, the other relevant options are ignored even
if they are set.

                                                  *g:r7rs_more_parens*
                                                  *b:r7rs_more_parens*
If square brackets `[]` and curly braces `{}` are included in this option,
they are accepted as additional parentheses.
>
    let _:r7rs_more_parens = ']}'  " default: ']'
<
It does not care about whether the parens are opening `[{` or closing `]}`.

                                            *g:r7rs_strict_identifier*
                                            *b:r7rs_strict_identifier*
If this option is turned off, any identifier other than single `.` are
accepted. If turned on, only those specified in R7RS are accepted.
>
    let _:r7rs_strict_identifier = 1  " default: 0
<
If this option is turned on, identifiers starting from digits, containing
non-ascii letters, etc. are rejected. For more details, see R7RS
(https://small.r7rs.org/), sec. 7.1.1 (p. 62) and the errata
(https://small.r7rs.org/wiki/R7RSSmallErrata/), 7.
