OPTIONS                                          *r7rs-syntax-options*

For all options below, if both global and buffer local ones are found, the
buffer local one takes precedence.

                                                       *g:r7rs_strict*
                                                       *b:r7rs_strict*
The following lets syntax highlight strictly obey the Scheme language
specification in the R7RS report: it restricts use of `[]` and `{}` as
parentheses (see |g:r7rs_more_parens|) and rejects some identifiers that could
be accepted in the wild (see |g:r7rs_strict_identifier|).
>
    let g:r7rs_strict = 1  " default: 0
    let b:r7rs_strict = 1  " default: 0
<
Turning it on is identical to setting
>
    let _:r7rs_more_parens = ''
    let _:r7rs_strict_identifier = 1
<
where `_` reads either `g` or `b` henceforth.

Note: If |g:r7rs_strict| or |b:r7rs_strict| is set, the other relevant options
are ignored even if they are set.

                                                  *g:r7rs_more_parens*
                                                  *b:r7rs_more_parens*
If square brackets `[]` and curly braces `{}` are included in this option,
they are accepted as additional parentheses by syntax highlight.
>
    let _:r7rs_more_parens = ']}'  " default: ']'
<
It does not care about whether opening `[{` or closing `]}`.

                                            *g:r7rs_strict_identifier*
                                            *b:r7rs_strict_identifier*
If this option is turned off, any identifier other than single `.` are
accepted by syntax highlight. If turned on, only those specified in the R7RS
report are accepted.
>
    let _:r7rs_strict_identifier = 1  " default: 0
<
If this option is turned on, for example, identifiers starting from digits or
containing non-ascii letters are rejected. For more details, see the R7RS
report (https://small.r7rs.org/), sec. 7.1.1 (p. 62) and the errata
(https://small.r7rs.org/wiki/R7RSSmallErrata/), 7.
